# Some lyrics

Kendal B Carter
She's always much smarter
  than the day before

Her fingers are pointy
She uses them jointly
  to tell us the score

She only tells us the rules
  when we break them
She suffers all of the fools
  but she loves them


Kendal B Carter
Keeps working much harder
  than the day before

She makes funny faces
In public places
  to ask us for more

# Some seed lines

"I'm not bored..."

"I have four at my house"
"I have two moms"

Also mention something about tags (blanket, puppy, etc)
