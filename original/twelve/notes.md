A song about my 12 hour drinking session back in '98.

# What actually happened

It was a long time ago (18 years!) so I don't remember much, BUT:

  - Occasion was my last day at Coast Commercial Bank
  - Started in Palomar cantina around 2pm
    - Joined by some CCB folks
    - Had some margarittas
    - Ate some food
  - Moved on to Red Room around 5-6?
    - Met Christian
    - Others joined and left through the evening
    - Went home around 2am
